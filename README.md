# HalfWit (WIP)
HalfWit is a simple Vue & Electron experiment to return GIFs related to a pasted sentence. The app queries the Giphy API which seemingly is intelligent enough to perform partial matching on the `q` parameter.

Clicking on a returned GIF will copy its URL to the user's clipboard so they can quickly respond to a topic of conversation with a relevant GIF
